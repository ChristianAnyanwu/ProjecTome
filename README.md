# ProjecTome
Project Management Software with Interactive commands received through Text Messages

ProjecTome is a block based architecture that allows many different project types to interface with a user in the same way. Using commands sent via text, email or on the screen ProjecTome allows users to adjust and provide input to complex or time intensive projects when not actively near the computer.

For example: While in class a project I leave running on my computer may require input about what to do with an error or what to work on next. That can be provided through the command system via a quick text and my code is back up and running.
