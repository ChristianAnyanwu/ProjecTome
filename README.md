# ProjecTome
Project Management Software with Interactive commands received through Text Messages

ProjecTome is a block based architecture that allows many different project types to interface with a user in the same way. Using commands sent via text, email or on the screen ProjecTome allows users to adjust and provide input to complex or time intensive projects when not actively near the computer.

For example: While in class a project I leave running on my computer may require input about what to do with an error or what to work on next. That can be provided through the command system via a quick text and my code is back up and running.

The whole system relies on two parts, one Core, and many Bases. 

-The Core: is the singular point of management. It takes in the user input and maintains the current context and processes. This part is static for every project.

-A Base: is a certain project or jar that can be run. Its a set of code or unique project that a user wants to use. Bases are interchangeable. The core can hold multiple bases and allow input and output to each as nessecary.
